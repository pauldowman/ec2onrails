* EU AMI's: ami-761c3402 (32-bit) and ami-701c3404 (64-bit)

== 0.9.9 2008-07-01

* ami-c9bc58a0 (32-bit) and ami-cbbc58a2 (64-bit)
* This is another test release, still not intended to be production-ready. Look for version 1.0. Almost there!!
* Updated to Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy"
* Added new required option to :ec2onrails_config in deploy.rb: ec2onrails_config[:archive_to_bucket_subdir] is used by the ec2onrails:db:archive Capistrano task. See http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/documentation/examples/deploy.rb
* Database backup script parameters changed, now takes --reset to reset the binary logs, no longer takes --no-reset (not resetting the binary logs is now the default)
* Database backup script no longer resets binary log file numbering
* Now includes Rails 2.1.0 (still includes 2.0.2 and 1.2.6)
* Incremental database backup frequency increased to every 5 minutes since it's very inexpensive to do

* This is another test release, still not intended to be production-ready. Look for version 1.0. Almost there!!
* Bug fix: if :ec2onrails[:enable_ssl] = true the setup task fails due to /etc/init.d/apache2 not executable
* Bug fix: retry if needed on the first mysqld startup, because on first startup sometimes the /etc/init.d/mysql startup script thinks it failed because mysqld took too long to physically write the logs full.

* ami-b657b2df (32-bit) and ami-8957b2e0 (64-bit)

* Added monit monitoring daemon: monitors mysqld, apache, memcached, mongrels, system load and free drive space
* Enabled postfix by default, mail is delivered to admin user (or use new ec2onrails[:admin_mail_forward_address] option in deploy.rb to forward admin mail to an email address)

* ami-bdf411d4
* First release built with new rake build script, this is a test release, not intended to be production-ready until it's tested more thoroughly.
* Amazon EC2 API tools (java-based) no longer installed by default because they're not used on most servers. They're needed only for registering a rebundled image so there's now a script to install them: /usr/local/ec2-on-rails/install_ec2_api_tools.sh. The ruby-based EC2 image tools are still installed.
* Removed "http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/libs/sun-java6-jre":Java and it's massive list of dependencies because it was only needed for the EC2 API tools. This saved a huge amount of space.
