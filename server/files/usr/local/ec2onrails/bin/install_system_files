# This script installs system files that are included in the deployed Rails
# app. The files are copied from RAILS_ROOT/config/ec2onrails/system_files 
# (i.e. /mnt/app/current/config/ec2onrails/system_files) to the root
# of the system, keeping their subdirectories.
#
# For example, to replace /etc/nginx/nginx.conf with your own customized
# version, you would create config/ec2onrails/system_files/nginx/nginx.conf
# in your rails app.
#
# If the files being installed are overwriting an existing system file,
# that file will be renamed to <original_name>.ec2onrails_backup
#
# An optional "manifest" file can be created that lists all the files.
# 
# Before installing the files, or when given the --uninstall flag, it will
# remove the previously installed files. This only works if the previously
# installed files had a manifest.
#
# This replaces the ec2onrails:server:deploy_files Capistrano task that
# uploaded a set of files from anywhere on the deployer's computer. The
# advantage of doing it this way is that the system config files are deployed
# with the app, and kept with the app in your revision control system where
# they can be branched, etc., together with the app, then uninstalled cleanly
# when redeploying a different version of the app.
