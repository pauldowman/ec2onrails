    <h2>Deploy a Ruby on Rails app on <span class="caps">EC2</span> in five minutes</h2>


	<p><span class="caps">EC2</span> on Rails is an Ubuntu Linux server image for 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2/102-6342260-7987311?ie=UTF8&#38;node=201590011&#38;no=3435361">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="caps">EC2</span> hosting service</a>
that&#8217;s ready to run a standard Ruby on Rails application with little or no customization. 
It&#8217;s a Ruby on Rails <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_appliance">virtual appliance</a>.</p>


	<p>If you have an <span class="caps">EC2</span> account and can start <span class="caps">EC2</span> instances you&#8217;re five minutes away from deploying
your Rails app.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">EC2</span> on Rails is <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php">opinionated software</a>:
the opinion is that for many rails apps the server setup can be generalized
and shared the same way as the web application framework itself. For many people (Twitter, this isn&#8217;t for you) 
the server image can be treated the same way as other shared libraries. And if the day comes when your needs are
unique enough that <span class="caps">EC2</span> on Rails can&#8217;t be configured to work for you then you can bundle your own image from it
or fork the build source and customize it.</p>


	<p>But until then, why spend your time configuring servers?</p>


	<p>Features of the <span class="caps">EC2</span> image:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Ready to deploy a Rails app with little or no configuration of the server required</li>
		<li>Automatic backup of MySQL database to S3 (full backup nightly + incremental backup using binary logs every 5 minutes)</li>
		<li>Capistrano tasks to customize the server image, archive and restore the database to/from S3, and more (available as a rubygem)</li>
		<li>Mongrel_cluster behind Apache 2.2, configured according to 
  <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/2006/06/19/time-for-a-grown-up-server-rails-mongrel-apache-capistrano-and-you/">Coda Hale&#8217;s excellent guide</a></li>
		<li>Ruby on Rails 2.1.0, 2.0.2 and 1.2.6</li>
		<li>Ruby 1.8.6</li>
		<li>MySQL 5</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/">monit</a> configured to monitor apache, mongrel, mysql, memcached, drive space and system load</li>
		<li>Ubuntu 8.04 <span class="caps">LTS</span> &#8220;Hardy&#8221; base image built using <a href="http://alestic.com/">Eric Hammond&#8217;s <span class="caps">EC2</span> Ubuntu script</a></li>
		<li><span class="caps">SSL</span> support</li>
		<li>Amazon <span class="caps">AMI</span> tools installed</li>
		<li>MySQL, Apache, and syslog configured to use /mnt for data and logging so you don&#8217;t fill up <span class="caps">EC2</span>&#8217;s small root filesystem</li>
		<li>Automatically archives Rails and Apache logs to S3 nightly.</li>
		<li>32-bit and 64-bit images available (supports all instance types, small to extra large).</li>
		<li>Created using a build file, full source is <a href="http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=4552">available</a> (the <span class="caps">EC2</span> on Rails script is run from <a href="http://alestic.com/">Eric Hammond&#8217;s <span class="caps">EC2</span> Ubuntu script</a>)</li>
		<li>Can be used as a clustered Rails app running on multiple instances</li>
		<li>Automatically runs hourly, daily, weekly and monthly scripts if they exist in Rails application&#8217;s script directory</li>
		<li>Local <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> SMTP mail server (only available from within the instance, not listening on external network interfaces)</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Using the image</h2>


	<p>This documentation will be improved soon, for now hopefully this covers the basics.</p>


The current <span class="caps">AMI</span> id&#8217;s are:
	<ul>
	<li>ami-c9bc58a0 (32-bit)</li>
		<li>ami-cbbc58a2 (64-bit)</li>
	</ul>


	<p><em>I will keep these images available for as long as possible, they will not be deleted for at least a few years.</em></p>


	<h4>1. Install the gem</h4>


<pre>sudo gem install ec2onrails</pre>

	<h4>2. Add the config files to your Rails app</h4>


	<p>Put <a href="http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/documentation/examples/Capfile">Capfile</a> 
in the root of your rails folder, and put
<a href="http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/documentation/examples/deploy.rb">deploy.rb</a> 
and
<a href="http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/documentation/examples/s3.yml">s3.yml</a>
in the config folder.</p>


	<p><em>Be sure to customize those files and read the comments.</em></p>


	<p>Also, use the hostname &#8220;db_primary&#8221; in your database.yml file. After running &#8220;cap ec2onrails:server:set_roles&#8221; it will resolve
to the instance defined in your Capistrano &#8220;db&#8221; role.</p>


	<h4>4. Start up one or more instances of the image.</h4>


	<p>There is nothing <span class="caps">EC2</span> on Rails-specific here yet (though soon there will be a Capistrano task to do this for you), 
if you&#8217;ve started <span class="caps">EC2</span> instances before you can skip this section. Otherwise, I&#8217;m not going to lie, this part is complicated
and will take a lot more than 5 minutes the first time.</p>


	<p>Read the 
<a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/GettingStartedGuide/running-an-instance.html">running an instance section</a>
in Amazon&#8217;s getting started guide.</p>


	<p>For the <span class="caps">AMI</span> id&#8217;s of the current images do <code>cap ec2onrails:ami_ids</code> from within the app that you 
configured in the previous step (they&#8217;re also listed earlier on this page).</p>


	<p><em><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: Only use the images that match the current version of the gem.</em></p>


	<p>Please see the <a href="http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/gem/CHANGELOG">change log</a> for release notes, and 
see the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=17558&#38;group_id=4552&#38;func=browse">list of open issues</a>.</p>


	<p>As is <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/DeveloperGuide/public-ami-guidelines.html">standard for public <span class="caps">AMI</span>&#8217;s</a>, 
password-based logins are disabled. You log in with your own 
<a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/GettingStartedGuide/running-an-instance.html">public/private keypair</a>.</p>


	<p>Most basic things can be configured automatically by the Capistrano tasks, but if you want to 
you can login by ssh as a user named &#8220;admin&#8221; (has sudo ability) or as &#8220;app&#8221; (the user 
that the app runs as, does not have sudo ability). The Capistrano tasks automatically 
use the app user to deploy the app, and the admin user for server admin tasks 
that require sudo.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">IMPORTANT</span>: Double-check <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/GettingStartedGuide/running-an-instance.html">your firewall settings</a>. 
Be sure that you haven&#8217;t allowed public access to any ports other than <span class="caps">TCP 22</span> and <span class="caps">TCP 80</span>
(and possibly <span class="caps">TCP 443</span> if you&#8217;re going to enable <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>).
If you&#8217;re using multiple instances, be sure to allow them network access to each other.</p>


	<h4>5. Copy your public key from the server to keep Capistrano happy</h4>


	<p>This is a workaround for a quirk in Capistrano. Technically all you should need to connect to the server is the private 
key file, the public key is on the server. But for some reason 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano/browse_thread/thread/1102208ff925d18">Capistrano requires that you have both the public key and the private key files together on the client</a>.</p>


	<p>There is a Capistrano task that tries to fix this for you. From within the root of your rails app do:</p>


<pre>cap ec2onrails:get_public_key_from_server</pre>

	<p>Note, this will only work if you have an external ssh command in the path, it won&#8217;t work for most Windows users.</p>


	<h4>6. Deploy the app with Capistrano</h4>


	<p>Now that the gem is installed, your deploy.rb is configured and you can start and stop <span class="caps">EC2</span> instances, 
this is the only thing you&#8217;ll need to do from now on.</p>


<pre>
cap ec2onrails:setup
cap deploy:cold
</pre>

	<p>Yes, it&#8217;s that easy! The setup task will set the server&#8217;s timezone, install any 
gems and Ubuntu packages that you specified in the config file, and 
create your database.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s it, your app is now running on <span class="caps">EC2</span>!!</p>


	<h2>Capistrano tasks</h2>


	<p><a href="http://capify.org">Capistrano</a> is the most commonly used Rails deployment tool. It comes with many standard &#8220;tasks&#8221;,
and the <span class="caps">EC2</span> on Rails gem includes Capistrano tasks specifically for configuring the server instance.</p>


	<p>Capistrano is run from the command-line using the &#8220;cap&#8221; command, with a task name given as an argument.</p>


	<h3>Commonly-used tasks</h3>


	<p>You&#8217;ll mostly need just the following Capistrano tasks:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><code>cap ec2onrails:ami_ids</code>
Shows the <span class="caps">AMI</span> id&#8217;s of the images that match the current version of the gem.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><code>cap ec2onrails:setup</code>
This task configures a newly-launched instance. This is the first thing you should do after
starting a new instance. It can be run more than once without ill effect. After running 
&#8220;cap ec2onrails:setup&#8221; the next thing to do is run &#8220;cap deploy:cold&#8221;</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><code>cap ec2onrails:server:set_roles</code>
Customizes each instance for it&#8217;s role(s) (as defined in your Capistrano deploy.rb file).
Run this after starting or stopping instances.
For now this just makes sure that only the appropriate services (Apache, Mongrel, and/or MySQL)
are running. Eventually this will customize settings for the running services also. Note that
an instance can have more than one role. If there&#8217;s only one instance it will have all roles.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Note that due to the way that Capistrano works all tasks are run
against all hosts that are currently defined in the deploy.rb file.
So if you start a new instance then add it to your deploy.rb you will need to run 
&#8220;cap ec2onrails:setup&#8221; again which will be run on all existing instances.</p>


	<h3>Database management tasks</h3>


	<ul>
	<li><code>cap ec2onrails:db:archive</code>
Archive the MySQL database to the bucket specified in your deploy.rb. This is for archiving a snapshot of your
database into any S3 bucket. For example, you might want to do this before deploying.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><code>cap ec2onrails:db:restore</code>
Restore the MySQL database from the bucket specified in your deploy.rb
For example, I use this to restore the current production data (from my actual production backup
bucket) onto a staging server that has the current production version of my
app. I then deploy the new version which tests migrations exactly as they&#8217;ll
run on the production server.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>To get a full list of the Capistrano tasks at any time type <code>cap -T</code> from with your rails app root.</p>


	<h2>Building the image</h2>


	<p>Building the image is not required, most people will simply use the prebuilt public
image, but there is also a build script that builds the image. It&#8217;s meant to be called by
<a href="http://alestic.com/">Eric Hammond&#8217;s <span class="caps">EC2</span> Ubuntu script</a>.</p>


	<h2>Mailing lists</h2>


	<p>There are two Google groups, one for 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ec2-on-rails-announce">announcements</a>
(usually just new release announcements) and one for 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ec2-on-rails-discuss">discussion</a>.</p>
